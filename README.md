Description of the project.-
This project consists in developing a copy of the wide-known application: Airbnb.
Airbnb is a web page/app where anyone can find a place when visiting any part of the world.
The dynamic is quite simple: in the city/place you're inhabitating you look for a department/house which may like you, and you rent it.
It could be since one night until several nights
